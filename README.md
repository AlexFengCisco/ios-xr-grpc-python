* Grpc for Cisco IOS-XR in python

This is a small repo testing GRPC in python for the IOS-XR end node. This setup is currently working in the IOS-XRv on vagrant. 
To get started there are two examples here, one for MDT and one for grpc rpc calls.

**GRPC Calls
The file is called example_grpc.py. This file has an excamples of the different rpc calls. This configuration shows how to get things started with self signed certs.

1. Download the repository
2. Install grpc
```pip install grpcio``` (sudo may be required)
3. ssh into the router and turn on grpc and tls on the router, below is an example configuration.
```
interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0/0
 ipv4 address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0
 no shut

grpc
 tls
 port 57777
 !
!
```
4. Copy the autogenerated .pem file to the 'keys' folder in the client directory.
```scp cisco@192.168.1.2:/misc/config/grpc/ems.pem ./```
5. If you are using your own box, change the parameters in the example.py file to have the proper authentication credentials. 
6.. Run the program ```python example.py```

(note if you don't want to use TLS, a client with insecure transport is provided, change the import statement from client.cisco_grpc_client to client.cisco_grpc_client_insecure)
